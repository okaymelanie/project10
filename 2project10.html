<p>My name is Melanie Vizcarra and I am 14 years old. I was born in April 25th, 2002.
I have lived in Covina practically all my life. I go to Covina High School. I live with 
my parents, grandparents, and sister. I have a dog named Roxy, she's six years old. I have 
big family which most live in Bakersfield and some in Mexico. 
<p> A place I would like to visit is Germany, Europe. My favorite subject is history 
because I like to learn about how life was back in the day. I love to watch Netflix everyday
im currently watching a show called Shameless. I dont really like sports and I hate reading.
I am a very funny and sweet person when you get to know me. After highschool I plan to 
enroll in a 4 year collage or maybe go straight into career. I dont know what I'd make of
myself but I hope it's something big.
