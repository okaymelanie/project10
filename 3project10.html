<p> People everywhere download music illegally for free, some might not know they're doing
it and some might know. If I had access to illegally download music, I would not. Three
reasons why you should not download music illegally are because its obviously illegal, 
can go to jail, and its not right. What you shouldn't do is go tell everyone about the 
website, download music from the website, and most importantly, make your own website. 
There are many apps out there with music you can play for free like Spotify or Pandora.
